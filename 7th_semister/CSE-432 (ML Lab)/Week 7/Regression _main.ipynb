It is a core component of supervised learning, where the algorithm is trained with both input features and output labels to establish a relationship among variables. For instance, in predicting a car's fuel efficiency based on attributes like weight and horsepower, regression can help estimate the miles per gallon for different models. The most common form of regression is linear regression due to its simplicity and effectiveness in forecasting. However, there are various types of regression models, including logistic and polynomial, each suited for different kinds of data and analysis needs. Evaluating the performance of a regression model involves considering metrics like variance and bias to ensure accurate predictions and generalization to new data."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"39a91f9b","metadata":{"id":"39a91f9b"},"source":["**7.1 Importing modules**"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"2da494cc","metadata":{"id":"2da494cc"},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"de88ed6a","metadata":{"id":"de88ed6a"},"source":["**7.2 Importing and Preprocessing Data Set**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c9c4b039","metadata":{"id":"c9c4b039"},"source":["The Productivity Prediction of Garment Employees dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/597/productivity+prediction+of+garment+employees) will be used for this task.
